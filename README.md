# Meme Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Exercise from the [freeCodeCamp ReactJS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&list=PL3mY6d1fMqmIN7e8w-_p_F9qwjqvYBbFd&index=2&t=16771s).
Fetches an array of popular memes through an API call to [https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes](https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes) and displays a random meme. Also allows the user to insert captions to the meme image or to change the currenty displayed meme.

To get it running:
* Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en);
* Open your command line interface of choice and `cd` to the root folder of the repository (the one that contains the README.md file);
* Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies;
* After installing the dependencies, run `npm start`.
